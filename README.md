## Introduction
Understanding public sentiment is crucial for brands to monitor their reputation and customer satisfaction. This project leverages NLP and machine learning to classify social media posts into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes classifier
- Tokenization and stopword removal
- Data visualization of sentiment trends

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Installation
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-sentiment-analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd social-media-sentiment-analysis
    ```

3. Run the sentiment analysis script:
    ```bash
    python sentiment_analysis.py
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset should contain social media posts with their respective sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). Ensure the dataset is in CSV format with columns 'text' and 'sentiment'.

## Results
Include some visualizations of your results, such as sentiment distribution charts, word clouds, or accuracy metrics.

## Future Work
- Improve the model with more advanced algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, LSTM)
- Integrate real-time data collection using social media APIs
- Enhance the visualizations with interactive dashboards
